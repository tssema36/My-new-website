				<p>On this web page we shall look at the two main types of poverty these are Absolute poverty and Relative poverty.
				<br>
				-Absolute poverty is when a person can't even afford the basic needs such as food or shelter and many others this is the worst type of poverty as a person can't survive 
				<br>
				-Relative poverty is simply the type of poverty where a person's average income is relatively lower than the rest of the general population 
				<br>
				This isn't the worst type of poverty as a person can afford the essential basic needs but just has a lower standards of living compared to the rest of the population.</p>

				<br>
				-The luck of shelter
				<br>
				-Hunger
				<br>
				-Being sick and not being able to see a doctor 
				<br>
				-Lack of access to clean and safe water for both drinking and otrher activities 
				<br>
				The page has diagrams to show safe water and access to healthcare 
				<br>
				The webpage also has a diagram to ilustrate a poverty trap which all leads to low incomes</p>
